# About Sudoku
Sudoku is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9x9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.If you are looking for Free Printable Sudoku Puzzles then visit this page.If you are a crossword player and then see here all NYT Crossword Answers
